# Carbon Footprint Calculator üåç

## Project Overview
The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a web application designed to help users estimate their carbon emissions across various lifestyle categories, such as household energy, transportation, and general consumption. By inputting data on their daily activities, users can see an estimate of their personal carbon footprint and receive suggestions to reduce it. The app also includes an option to offset carbon emissions, promoting a path toward carbon neutrality.

## Key Features
1. **Emissions Calculator for Multiple Categories**  
   Users can calculate carbon emissions based on input for specific categories like household energy, flights, cars, motorbikes, and public transport, creating a comprehensive view of their overall footprint.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   Intuitive input fields are provided to ensure users can easily and accurately input vehicle specifications and other relevant data, ensuring precision in calculations.

3. **Personalized Feedback**  
   The app provides users with personalized advice on how to reduce emissions based on the data they input, helping them make more sustainable choices.

4. **Carbon Offset Option**  
   Users are encouraged to achieve carbon neutrality through an integrated offset option, allowing them to compensate for their emissions with equivalent environmental contributions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and accessible user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express to handle the application logic and APIs.
- **Database**: MongoDB (if data storage is applicable for tracking user inputs or results).
- **API Integration**: Carbon calculation APIs are integrated to provide accurate emissions data.

## Contribution Highlights
- **User-Friendly Input Design**: Developed accessible input fields that capture precise user data based on vehicle and travel specifications, ensuring accurate emissions calculations.
- **Carbon Offset Integration**: Added a feature to promote environmental impact reduction by offsetting emissions, encouraging users to take further action towards sustainability.
- **Personalized Sustainability Tips**: Created a feedback system to give users targeted advice on emission reduction, contributing to environmental sustainability goals.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Users enter data related to their lifestyle‚Äîsuch as vehicle type, fuel usage, flight duration, and household energy consumption.
2. **Calculation**: The application calculates the total emissions based on the provided data.
3. **Feedback & Offset**: Users receive tailored suggestions to reduce their footprint and are offered an option to offset their carbon emissions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
